\title{
Multivariate outlier detection for incomplete survey data
}
\description{The package \code{modi} is a collection of functions for multivariate outlier dedection and imputation. 
The aim is to provide a set of functions which cope with missing values and take sampling weights into account. 
The original functions were 
developed in the EUREDIT project. This work was partially supported by the EU FP5 ICT programme, 
the Swiss Federal Office of Education and Science and the Swiss Federal Statistical Office. 
Subsequent development was in the AMELI project of the EU FP7 SSH Programme and also supported by the 
University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW).
